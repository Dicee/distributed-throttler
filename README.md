# distributed-throttler
A little repo to test some technologies and concepts in a small, self-encapsulated project
## Learning objectives
- deploy a CDK stack like a native AWS customer, without using any Amazon-internal layer on top of AWS builder tools
- have an all-Kotlin repo from the infrastructure and the build to the code itself
- get a working Kotlin Docker image
- play a bit with Redis (more likely Valkey) and/or Memcache
- implement different algorithms for a distributed throttler and test it out
